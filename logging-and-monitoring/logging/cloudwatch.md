# CloudWatch

## Unified CloudWatch agent

The unified CloudWatch agent enables you to do the following:

* Collect internal system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems.
* Collect system-level metrics from on-premises server.
* Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols.
* Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.

You can store and view the metrics that you collect with the CloudWatch agent in CloudWatch just as you can with any other CloudWatch metrics. Application log files can be collected.
