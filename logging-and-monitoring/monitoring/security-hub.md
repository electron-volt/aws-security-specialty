# Security Hub

Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your high-priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts in one place, enabling better visibility to these indicators. AWS Security Hub is not Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software and does not store log data, but instead aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services.
