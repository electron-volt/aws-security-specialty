## Credential report&#x20;

You can generate and download a _credential report_ that lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices. This is very useful in monitoring for unused passwords and access keys as well as auditing the lifecycle requirements of those credentials.&#x20;

In an AWS organization with many member accounts, you can run the credential report in every member account separately and then consolidate the reports. Here is an example implementation [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/infrastructure-and-automation/automate-iam-credential-reports-at-scale-across-aws/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/infrastructure-and-automation/automate-iam-credential-reports-at-scale-across-aws/)

## IAM Access Analyzer

AWS IAM Access Analyzer provides the following capabilities:

* Access Analyzer helps [identify resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-resource-identification) in your organization and accounts that are shared with an external entity.
* Access Analyzer [validates IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-policy-validation) against policy grammar and best practices.
* Access Analyzer [generates IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-policy-generation) based on access activity in your AWS CloudTrail logs.

If you are using CloudTrail to record API calls, then you can use Access Analyzer to generate an IAM policy based on CloudTrail logs.&#x20;

## IAM Policy Simulator

With the IAM policy simulator, you can test and troubleshoot identity-based policies, IAM permissions boundaries, Organizations service control policies (SCPs), and resource-based policies.

## AWS Security Token Service (STS)

Temporary security credentials are generated by AWS STS. By default, AWS STS is a global service with a single endpoint at `https://sts.amazonaws.com`. To reduce latency you can also use STS regional endpoints. In that case, if you use CloudTrail be sure to enable CloudTrail in all those regions as well.&#x20;

For a principal to be able to assume a role, the trust policy of the role must grant that principal permission for the action sts:AssumeRole.
