# AWS Abuse

AWS detects abuse activities in your resources using mechanisms, such as:

* AWS internal event monitoring.
* External security intelligence against AWS network address space.
* Internet abuse complaints against AWS resources.

Although the AWS abuse response team aggressively monitors and shuts down unauthorized activity running on AWS, the majority of abuse complaints refer to customers who have legitimate business on AWS. Some examples of common causes of unintentional abuse activities include:

* **Compromised resource** – An unpatched Amazon EC2 instance could be infected and become a botnet agent.
* **Unintentional abuse** – An overly aggressive web crawler might be classified as a denial-of-service attack by some internet sites.
* **Secondary abuse** – An end user of the service provided by an AWS customer might post malware files on a public Amazon S3 bucket.
* **False complaints** – Sometimes internet users mistakenly report legitimate activities as abuse.
