### Traffic Mirroring

Traffic Mirroring provides deep insight into network traffic by allowing you to analyze actual traffic content, including payload. Traffic Mirroring is targeted for use cases like detecting and stopping insider abuse or compromised workloads.

Traffic mirroring copies traffic from the elastic network interfaces of EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for content inspection.&#x20;
