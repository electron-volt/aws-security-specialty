# Unauthorized access

If you observe unauthorized activity within your AWS account, or you believe that an unauthorized party accessed your account, then do the following:

* Rotate and delete all root and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access keys.
* Delete any potentially unauthorized IAM users, and then change the password for all other IAM users.
* Check your bill. Your bill can help you identify resources that you didn’t create.
* Delete any resources on your account that you didn’t create.
* Enable MFA on the root user and any IAM users with console access.
* Verify that your account information is correct.
* Respond to the notifications that you received from AWS Support through the AWS Support Center.
