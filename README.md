# Introduction

## AWS Certified Security Specialty

The AWS SCS-C01 exam tests your knowledge of securing workloads and data in the AWS cloud. The exam has five domains:

* Infrastructure security (26%)
* Data protection (22%)
* IAM (20%)
* Logging and monitoring (20%)
* Incident response (12%).&#x20;

The percentages describe the relative weights of the different domains. The exam has 65 multiple choice questions. You can assume that around a quarter of these questions will be about infrastructure security, whereas incident response will feature in only about every eighth question.&#x20;

## FAQ

### What is the purpose of this course?&#x20;

This course attempts to provide you with useful information that will either help you pass the Security specialty exam or just broaden your understanding of securing workloads running in AWS.

### How is this course set up?&#x20;

Content is grouped together according to the domains of the exam. We will not attempt to cover all of the theory, but rather focus on useful hints related to possible exam questions.&#x20;

At the end of the course and sprinkled throughout you will find links to AWS whitepapers, with summaries that outline the most relevant points.&#x20;

### What kind of background do I need?&#x20;

The security specialty is an intermediate/advanced certification, so previous experience with AWS is a must. You should have a fundamental theoretical understanding as well as some hands-on experience of at least the following AWS technologies and services:

* VPC
* EC2, EBS, Auto-Scaling
* ELB, CloudFront, API Gateway
* IAM&#x20;
* S3, Glacier
* AWS shared responsibility model

and so on. Associate-level courses like [Developer Associate ](https://eve-4.gitbook.io/developer-associate-intensive-course/)will provide a good background. &#x20;

It is also very useful to have a high-level understanding of AWS Organizations.&#x20;
